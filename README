Rainbow CSV provides a way to highlight logical columns in different rainbow 
colors. This helps to understand data patterns in csv, tsv, etc files more 
quickly, especially when fields in the same column have different lengths. Every
10-th column has a default font color, so it's easy to find out column numbers

There are 2 ways to enable csv columns highlighting:
        1. CSV autodetection based on buffer content
        2. Manual CSV delimiter selection

When new buffer is opened Rainbow CSV analyzes it's content and tries to
autodect whether it is a csv file or not; and if it is, what character this
csv is delimited by. This would work only if no other syntax rules has been
set for buffer. Buffer's file extension is irrelevant for autodetection, there
can be no extension at all or a buffer content could be read by vim from stdin -
autodetection would work in any case.

If autodetection mechanism was disabled or failed for some reason, you can 
specify a delimiter manualy: execute command 'RainbowDelim' and a character under 
the cursor would be used as the csv delimiter for columns highlighting.

If you don't like default column colors, you can define your own.

Commands:
  :RainbowDelim - Manualy select csv delimiter under cursor and highlight columns in different colors
  :NoRainbowDelim - Disable rainbow csv syntax for current buffer.
