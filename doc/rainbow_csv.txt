Rainbow CSV provides a way to highlight logical columns in different rainbow 
colors. This helps to understand data patterns in csv, tsv, etc files more 
quickly especially when fields in the same column have different lengths. 
Every 10-th column has a default font color, so it's easy to find out column 
numbers

There are 2 ways to enable csv columns hithlighting:
        1. CSV autodetection based on buffer content
        2. Manual CSV delimiter selection

When new buffer is opened Rainbow CSV analyzes it's content and tries to
autodect whether it is a csv file or not; and if it is, what character this
csv is delimited by. This would work only if no other syntax rules has been
set for buffer. Buffer's file extension is irrelevant for autodetection, there
can be no extension at all or buffer content can be read by vim from stdin -
autodetection would work in any case.

If autodetection mechanism was disabled or failed for some reason, you can 
specify delimiter manualy: execute command |'RainbowDelim'| and character under 
cursor would be used as csv delimiter for columns highlighting.

If you don't like default column colors, you can define your own.

2. Configuration
                                                            *'rcsv_delimiters'*
'rcsv_delimiters'  list  (default: [	,] )
                   global
    By default plugin checks only TAB and comma characters when it analyzes 
    buffer content, but you can specify your own set of autodetectable 
    delimiters by defining a |'g:rcsv_delimiters'| list in your .vimrc

    Example
    (plugin would check TAB, semicolon, colon and whitespace on autodetect):
>
     let g:rcsv_delimiters = [	;: ]
<

                                             *'disable_rainbow_csv_autodetect'*
'disable_rainbow_csv_autodetect'  boolean  (default: undefined)
                                  global
   If plugin csv autodetection feature gives to much false positives for you,
   you can disable this mechanism by defining |'disable_rainbow_csv_autodetect'|
   option in your .vimrc
   Example:
>
     let g:disable_rainbow_csv_autodetect = 1
<
   You would be able to use manual csv delimiter selection still.

                                                           *'rcsv_max_columns'*
'rcsv_max_columns'  integer (default: 20)
                    global
   Autodetection would fail if buffer has more than rcsv_max_columns columns.
   You can rise or lower this limit.
   Example:
>
     let g:rcsv_max_columns = 30
<
   NOTE: setting rcsv_max_columns to a big value may slow down csv files
   display

                                                            *'rcsv_colorpairs'*
'rcsv_delimiters'  list (default: see autoload/rainbow_csv.vim)
                   global
   If you don't like default column colors, you can define your own.
   Example (1,6,11... columns are darkred, and every 5-th column have default 
   font color)
>
     let g:rcsv_colorpairs = [
         \ ['darkred',     'darkred'],
         \ ['darkblue',    'darkblue'],
         \ ['darkgreen',   'darkgreen'],
         \ ['darkmagenta', 'darkmagenta'],
         \ ['NONE',        'NONE'],
         \ ]

3. Commands
                                                                 *RainbowDelim*
:RainbowDelim
   This command will mark current file as csv and highlight columns in rainbow
   colors, character under cursor will be used as a delimiter

                                                               *NoRainbowDelim*
:NoRainbowDelim
   This command will disable rainbow columns highlighting for current file.
   Usefull when autodection mechanism failed and marked non csv file as csv
